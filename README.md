# Steganography-Online-Codec
The Steganography Online Codec is a web application that allows users to hide and retrieve text messages within image files. This process, known as steganography, is a technique for concealing information by embedding it into other non-suspicious files, making it an excellent way to maintain privacy and security.
Here's a simple `README.md` file for your project:

## Features

- **Encode Messages:** Hide a text message within an image using a password for encryption.
- **Decode Messages:** Retrieve the hidden message from an image using the correct password.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for encoding and decoding messages.

## How It Works

1. **Encoding:**
   - Upload an image file.
   - Enter a password for encryption.
   - Type the message you want to hide.
   - Click the "Encode" button to embed the message into the image.
   - Download the newly created image with the hidden message.

2. **Decoding:**
   - Upload the image file with the hidden message.
   - Enter the password used during encoding.
   - Click the "Decode" button to extract the hidden message.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For encoding and decoding messages.

## Files Included

- `sten.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for encoding and decoding messages.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `sten.html` in a web browser.
3. Use the interface to encode or decode messages within image files.

## Important Notes

- Ensure the image file is large enough to hold the message.
- Use a strong password for encryption to enhance security.
- The application is for demonstration purposes and may not be suitable for production use without further enhancements.
